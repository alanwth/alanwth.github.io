This is a page contating some of the problem sets I have completed for the CS50 introduction to computer science online course.
In my opinion, this is one of the most comprehensive course and I have learnt a lot able computer science, including programming 
and also other aspect such as data structure, how computer memory work and concepts such as run time of a programme.

Unforuntly however, some of the work were stored offline in my old laptop and not saved onto the cloud, and thus a majority of my code are
missing. I am currrently in progress of redoing some of the more advance Python project, and will be updating this page when possible.
